# Weather-App-
In this project, I have created a Weather App using Kotlin, Type in City Name and that's it you will get the weather of that city. I have used OpenWeatherMap API key to fetch the weather details of that particular city.

For the API key visit https://openweathermap.org/api create your Account and you will get your own unique API key and use that in your code.
